Administrator is a medium-difficulty Windows machine designed around a complete domain compromise scenario, where credentials for a low-privileged user are provided. To gain access to the michael account, ACLs (Access Control Lists) over privileged objects are enumerated, leading us to discover that the user olivia has GenericAll permissions over michael, allowing us to reset his password. With access as michael, it is revealed that he can force a password change on the user benjamin, whose password is reset. This grants access to FTP where a backup.psafe3 file is discovered, cracked, and reveals credentials for several users. These credentials are sprayed across the domain, revealing valid credentials for the user emily. Further enumeration shows that emily has GenericWrite permissions over the user ethan, allowing us to perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. The recovered hash is cracked and reveals valid credentials for ethan, who is found to have DCSync rights ultimately allowing retrieval of the Administrator account hash and full domain compromise.

First we do a full nmap scan:
```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.11.42

We notice the presence of an ftp server on port 21. 

We try to connect to it anonymously:
```
ftp anonymous@10.10.11.42
Connected to 10.10.11.42.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
331 Password required
Password: 
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection.
ftp: Login failed
```
but it asks for a password. 

We can tell from the ports that 10.10.11.42 is a domain controller.
